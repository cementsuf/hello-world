Tiptoe-ing into GitHub

Hello world, this is me.
Life should be, fun for everyone.

Every now and then I'm insecure,
let me show you life can be so pure.
Seize the day, wear a big, happy smile on your face.
On every life a little rain will fall,
that won't change my attitude at all.
You are you, I am me, we'll be free.
